        <h3> Hello! My name is Vivienne Tam. </h3>
          
        <p> I'm a current freshman at UMass Amherst majoring in computer science and planning to minor in psychology and business. Since the beginning of high school, 
          I've been interested in CS and I participated in multiple high school hackathons and was captain of my school's robotics team. 
          Though my college studies are just beginning, I'm excited and open to exploring all the different ways computer science can be applied in the field. 
          I'm currently looking for a summer internship to continue to gain more experience and learn more about the computer science industry.
